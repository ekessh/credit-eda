# Credit Risk Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description

This project is part of a PG program and focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario. It aims to provide a practical understanding of risk analytics within the banking and financial services industry. Participants will learn how data can be effectively utilized to minimize lending risks.

## Objectives

*   Apply EDA techniques to analyze and interpret financial data.
*   Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services.
*   Learn to identify key risk indicators that contribute to loan defaults.
*   Understand how data-driven decisions can minimize financial loss in lending.

## Key Drivers of Default Risk

The analysis identifies several key factors that drive loan default risk:

1.  **External Scores**: Lower external scores indicate a higher risk of default.
2.  **Income Type**: Certain income types suggest more stability than others, affecting default rates.
3.  **Education Type**: Lower education levels correlate with higher default risks.
4.  **Occupation Type**: Lower-skilled occupations tend to have higher default rates.
5.  **Age Group**: Younger borrowers exhibit higher default risks.
6.  **Total Income**: Higher-income individuals are less represented among defaulters.
7.  **Credit Amount**: Lenders are more cautious with credit amounts for potential defaulters.
8.  **Loan Annuity**: Higher annuity burdens may lead to increased default risks.
9.  **Contract Status of Previous Application**: More refusals in past applications indicate higher future default risks.
10. **Term of Credit at Previous Application**: Shorter repayment terms are more common among defaulters.

## Patterns and Insights

The project also explores various patterns through bivariate analysis, providing insights into how different factors interact and influence default risks. Key patterns include:

*   Income Total by External Score
*   Income Total by Income Type
*   Income Total by Education Type
*   Income Total by Occupation Type
*   Income Total by Age Group
*   Credit Amount by External Score
*   Credit Amount by Income Type
*   Credit Amount by Education Type
*   Credit Amount by Occupation Type
*   Credit Amount by Age Group
*   Loan Annuity by External Score
*   Loan Annuity by Income Type
*   Loan Annuity by Education Type
*   Loan Annuity by Occupation Type
*   Loan Annuity by Age Group
*   Term of Previous Credit by External Score
*   Term of Previous Credit by Income Type
*   Term of Previous Credit by Education Type
*   Term of Previous Credit by Occupation Type
*   Term of Previous Credit by Age Group

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

*   Implement risk-based pricing with dynamic interest rates.
*   Design segmented loan products tailored to different risk profiles.
*   Proactively monitor annuity-to-income ratios.
*   Diversify the loan portfolio to balance high and low-risk segments.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of EDA in credit risk analysis, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing loan defaults. The strategic recommendations aim to enhance risk management and decision-making processes in lending.
